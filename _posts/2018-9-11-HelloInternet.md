title: Hello Internet, I am here to make my presence!
---

As a fresh-off-the-University girl, I heard the term "Internet Presence" for the first time in my life last week. So, I decided to make my entrance to the internet world a little more official:

>"Please pardon my intrusion, Internet. I will like to make my presence here, thank you!"

That should get the formality out of the way.

As I typed out this blog post, I am still dazzled by how much my life changed in the last two weeks. I moved to Vancouver from Calgary and started the Master of Data Science program at UBC. So far, that still seemed sane.

Suddenly, I was playing with Git and Github, fondling with Jupyter Notebook, coding loops with Python, and head-aching with statistic. As I reminisced the days before this program started (two-weeks ago...), the most advanced thing that I could do on the computer was downloading custom ROMs for my phone. If this was not a life-changing experience, I would not know what is.

Valuable life-changing experience are rare in our life. Most people may only encounter one or two truly treasurable ones in their life time. Being enrolled in the MDS program would definitely be my top life-changing experience. The Master of Data Science program at UBC had expanded my horizon extensively within the first two week. (It's only been two weeks!) I am excited for all the skills and knowledge that this program would grant me in the next 10-months. I am ready to take on this challenge, because I know that in June 2019, I will walk away from this program with 73 battle-mates. We will be able to say gloriously and proudly "We are data scientists!"






<p style = "font-size:50%> P.S. For those that are wondering,
Yes, this blog post is here because I had to finish an assignment for the program. No one said that I couldn't use this chance to actually start my own personal blog right? </p> :grin:
